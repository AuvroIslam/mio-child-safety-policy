            <h2>1. Clear Policy Statement</h2>
            <p>Mio strictly prohibits any content or activity related to child sexual abuse material (CSAM) or child sexual abuse and exploitation (CSAE). Such content is absolutely not allowed on our platform.</p>
            <p>Any users found sharing, promoting, or engaging in such activities will have their accounts immediately terminated, and we will report the activity to the appropriate authorities, including the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), as required by law.</p>

        <section id="age-restriction">
            <h2>2. Minimum Age Requirement</h2>
            <p>Mio is intended solely for users aged 18 and older. This app is not designed for or directed at children.</p>
            <p>We explicitly prohibit individuals under the age of 18 from registering an account or using the Mio service. Our commitment to this age restriction is reflected in the 18+ badge displayed on our Google Play Store listing.</p>

        <section id="moderation">
            <h2>3. Moderation Practices</h2>
            <p>We employ a combination of methods to monitor user-generated content (including messages, profile information, photos, and usernames) and enforce our policies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>User Reporting:</strong> We rely on our user community to report content or behavior that violates our standards.</li>
                <li><strong>Automated Filtering:</strong> We utilize automated tools to detect potentially harmful content or patterns.</li>
                <li><strong>Manual Review:</strong> Our dedicated safety team manually reviews reported content and flagged accounts to ensure compliance.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Content or users found violating our child safety policies will be promptly removed or banned from the platform.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="user-reporting">
            <h2>4. User Reporting Mechanism</h2>
            <p>We empower our users to help maintain a safe environment. If you encounter any content or user that you believe violates our policies, especially concerning child safety or abuse, please use the in-app reporting feature immediately.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, you can report specific concerns directly to our moderation team via email at: <a href="mailto:abuse@mioapp.com">abuse@mioapp.com</a>. Please provide as much detail as possible to help us investigate.</p>
